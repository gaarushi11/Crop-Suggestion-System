# Crop Suggestion System

## Overview
This project implements an **IoT-enabled real-time crop suggestion and soil monitoring system** designed to assist farmers in making data-driven agricultural decisions. The system collects live environmental data from field-deployed sensors and analyzes soil and weather conditions to recommend suitable crops and irrigation actions.

By combining low-cost hardware with a web-based dashboard, the project aims to improve agricultural productivity, optimize resource usage, and reduce reliance on guesswork.

## Motivation
Agricultural decisions in India are often based on traditional knowledge rather than real-time data, leading to inefficient irrigation, poor crop selection, and reduced yields. With the availability of affordable sensors and microcontrollers, it is now possible to build intelligent systems that provide actionable insights to farmers based on actual field conditions.
